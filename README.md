# Pageturner
ISTE 430 Final group project
Our project will center around the design and development of an online and collaborative bookstore. There will be four main components to the bookstore: the webstore, personalized recommendation algorithm, library database, and book club forums. This collaborative bookstore is an experience that reignites user interest in reading and provides a platform for social interaction capable of establishing meaningful relationships in the current digital age.
